## Approach: Kadane's Algorithm
* * The given problem asks us to compute the maximum possible variance between
* * 2 characters in any substring of the given string. This value will be the
* * largest difference between the highest frequence element and the lowest frequency
* * element. This problem can be broken down so that we compute the maximum possible
* * variation between any 2 characters. By computing the maximum possible variation between
* * all unique characters and then getting the maximum among those values we can compute
* * the largest variance for String, s. We can start the problem by filling a hashmap with
* * the characters in the string and their respective counts. We can then iterate through
* * pairs of characters using a nested loop on the maps keyset. Once we have our primary
* * character and secondary character we can compute the maximum variance for those characters
* * using Kadane's algorithm. As we iterate through the characters in our string we can check
* * whether any of those characters belong to our pair. We can update the frequencies for those
* * characters. It is also important that we track the count of our secondary character. This
* * is so we can reset our frequencies. For example, if the secondary frequency outweighs the primary
* * frequency upto that point we know that the substring upto that point has already had its max variance
* * computed and continuing to work with that part of the string is pointless since our variance is lower
* * than 0 for the primary character. If we have more secondary characters we can simply, reset our string
* * to start at this new index and continue to calculate new frequencies. Therefore we reset our primary
* * and secondary frequencies that we might meet a better frequence later down the iteration of  our string.
* * We can keep a global variable for the nested loops which we can compare with our current max frequency
* * between 2 characters. At the end we can simply return our variance.
