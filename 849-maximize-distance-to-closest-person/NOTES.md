## Approach:
* Find the maximum gap between two one's while traversing the array. The potential answer will maximum gap between two one's by 2.
* Also we need to find the gap from left extreme i.e. 0 to first and last occupied seat to right extreme i.e. (n-1).
* The final answer will be max of these three.
